# Diabetes-data-set-using-Logistic-Regression

In this project I used the Pandas, Seaborn, and Machine Learning (Logistic Regression). 
Pandas is used for data loader and we can check if there is any null value in the data or not or it is also used to check 
the info of data and we can also get the many detail regarding the data. We can compare the different column of data 
and check the relation between them. 
Seaborn is mainly used to see the data in different graph form. In this project I use the heatmap to see the correlation 
between two entities, they can be used to visualize the correlation among the feature of a machine learning. 
In this project the machine learning algorithms used is Logistic Regression. First we split the data in train and test 
form then we fit the x and y train data in algorithms and train the ML and after that predict the y output and then 
check the Confusion matrix of the data in which we see the how much data is correct pred and how much uncorrect 
pred it give the data in matrix form and we also check the accuracy score.
